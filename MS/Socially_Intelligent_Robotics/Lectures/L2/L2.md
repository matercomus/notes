## Social robots?
- appearance -> sets expectations (if met then that gives trust)
	- human-inspired/animal-inspired/artifact-inspired/functional
	- real/imaginary
- social capabilities
- autonomy and intelligence

- proximity 
- temporal profile

## Social Capabilities
- communication
	- natural lang
	- non-verbal
 - expressing affect and perceiving human affect/emotions
 - expressing distinctive personality/character traits
 - modelling/recognizing social aspects of humans
 - Learning and developing new social skills and competencies
 - Establishing and maintaining social relationships

Social capabilities graph
- different flavors
- in the course focusing on sicialy evocative and sociabe: pro active (no cear cut)

## Purpose and application area
- healthcare
- education
- entertainment
- home and workplace
- search and rescue
- industry
- Public service
- Social sciences

- Challenges:
	- user-centered design based on intended application (users suck)
	- expand to new application areas

## Relational Role (robot to human)
- for (autonomous car)
- as (tele-presence)
- with (companion)
- around (package delivery robot)
- as part of (exoskeleton, wearable)
- as if (research tool)


## Autonomy and intelligence
- 6 levels of autonomy
- wizard of oz technique
  (pretending robot autonomous but in fact researcher controlling the robot)
  
- **autonomy** extend to which robot operates with out external interaction
- **intelligence** is ability to determine best course of action to satisfy goal in a foreign environment (dynamic uncertain)

- challenges:
	- ai will unlock gretar possibilities
	- sometimes more autonomy is not good


## Proximity
- remote
	- latency
	- social presence
	- shared autonomy
	- non-verbal communication

- co-located
	- situated communication
	- social navigation
	- perception of social cues
 
- physical
	- haptic control
	- social meaning of touch
	- safety


## Temporal profile
- Duration
	- short-term (attracting attantion, first impressions)
	- medium-term
	- long-term (novelty fades away, maintaining engagement, adaptation)
- Frequency
