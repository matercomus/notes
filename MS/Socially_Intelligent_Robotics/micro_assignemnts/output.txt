Micro -assignment  | Lecture 9 |  Socially Intelligent Robo�cs 2023  Deadline: Friday 01 December  2023  23:59    Mo�va�on   To design a social robot that can oﬀer meaningful support to people with demen�a we asked  crea�ve writers to create short stories in which they speculate about possible futures where these meaningful interac�ons take place. These stories are based on o r inspired by interviews with people  with demen�a, their caregivers, and robo�cists.   With these stories we hope to facilitate a discussion with all the stakeholders to iden�fy their interac�onal needs and determine what a meaningful interac�on even is.   With this micro -assignment we would like to involve you in this discussion as well.   Assignment   Bellow you will ﬁnd one of the short stories. You will read the story and highlight parts that feel meaningful to you (with the highlight func�onality of your pdf reader (e.g. Adobe Acrobat)) and add a comment to that highlighted text mo�va�ng what about it makes it meaningful for you.   Scien�ﬁc data collec�on   We would like to analyse your annota�ons  (i.e. highlights and comments)  to beter understand the  no�on of meaningfulness.   Data management   The annota�ons  and answers to the two experience ques�ons  are considered research data. They  will be extracted from the pd f, anonymized , and stored  for 10 years following the regula�ons of the  Dutch Universi�es1. Your anonymized annota�ons , or parts thereof , might be p ublished as part of  a  research paper, ar�s�c expression, or  science communica�on for the general public.  The answers to  the ques�ons will never be published.   You can opt -out of the assignment being used for scien�ﬁc research by checking the checkbox below.   If you don’t check the box you consent to use your annota�ons  and answers  in our scien�ﬁc  research. Note: if you opt -out, you s�ll have to do the assignment, but it will not be analysed as part  of our research.   Check box if you don’t want the assignment  to be used in our scientiﬁc research.

Morning Aerobics     I've often considered hanging a camera in the room. Just to see what she does when I'm not  home. Sometimes the television is suddenly on a different channel than the one I last left it  on: then I'm sure I turned it off after the morning news, but when I get home, it is on RTL4.  Maybe it was Robbie, I think, and she wanted to see Jinek back.   But I also want to see what she does because when I come home, she always sits on the  little step stool next to the door. I wonder if she's waiting for me there all day. Maybe it's a  hopeful thought, she knows I would like that and that's why she makes it seem that way,  but she rushes to that place every day when she hears my keys rattling against the front  door.   She sits there, on the step stool, and doesn't say anything. It smells like cleaning fluid. Her  head turns in my direction, following me as I walk to the couch and fall back against the soft  cushions. “I'm analyzing something,” she says. It still feels a b it awkward: the big, difficult  words she sometimes uses. Then she says analyze or calculate or calibrate in a tinny voice as  if she were reading from a textbook, even though she is the size of a toddler. A tall toddler,  well, maybe she's more like an eight -year -old, but still, a person her size wouldn't know how  to spell the word analyzer, let alone use it in a normal sentence.   “What then, Robbie?” I have made a sport of always calling her something different, but I often end up with variations of the word robot: Robbie, Roberta, Robster , or my favorite  Robusta, after the coffee bean.   'My recordings register that your right leg does not leave the ground properly when you  walk. You drag him behind you.”   “Are you trying to say I'm old?”   “It's not a judgement, Henry. I'm simply registering it.' She rises, rolls quietly away from her  position towards me, but collides at the edge of the carpet. She can't get over it, just like the  robot vacuum cleaner that seems to appear here sometimes. I don't know who put it here.  'Could it be that you pulled a muscle? I see that yesterday there was an agenda item called 'gardening' in your schedule.' Her eyes flash orange. I'm stuck, she tries to say. Help.   I place my left foot against the heel of my right shoe and pry it off my foot without untying the laces. Is that why there was dirt under my nails this morning and my shirt smelled like  potting soil?    “Could it be that you've been working in the garden and pulled a muscle?” She repeats it in  the same tinny, monotone tone, but it still feels more compelling. Pedantic, in a way, as if I have to explain to my mother why the chain on my bicycle is off again . Have you been racing  through the hills again, Henry?   

  I push myself against the worn bench with my arms and push myself up as smoothly as  possible, without squeaking. I carefully place my foot under her wheels and hoist her up  slightly. She rolls up the carpet.    'I feel great, Robster . No pain to be seen.'     She raises her left arm, outstretched, to shoulder height, then her right, crosses her body. I  have to avoid her outstretched arm, which shoots up dangerously close to my body, by taking a big step backwards.    'Imitate me. Try to raise and lower your arms slowly. Like you're fluttering, like a bird. I'll  count.'     “But my arms don't bother me.”    'One. Two. Three.' Her arms drop. You would expect them to jerk a little, the plastic to  rattle, but it happens with a smooth, gentle motion, like a synchronized swimmer. I imitate  her, flapping my arms faster than she does.    'You see? Nothing to worry about.'     Her head turns back one hundred and eighty degrees, like an owl. It's a horrible sight, a  robot that suddenly turns its own neck. The first time she did it, I thought: that was it, now  she falls down and I have to explain that it wasn't me, that she did it herself, but she  continued to talk happily, even joking that she had wanted they had also put eyes in the back of her head.     'And now lift your legs, one by one. Look, like this.' She raises her left leg, bends it at the  knee and brings it to her hip.     I imitate her, first my left leg and then the right, holding her shoulder with my hand so that I  don't lose my balance. It hurts in my lower back, but I try not to let it show.    “Now for the final exercise, I promise. A little dance.' Robusta starts moving her hips, first back and forth and then in circles, and something creaks. Her hinges, probably, although I  don't know if the parts she has , are called hinges. They probably have a difficult English  word for that, for the little screws and things that form the movement mechanism of her  hips.     

'You're cracking, Rob ster. Maybe you are ready for a new artificial hip, or at the very least  you need some oil to lubricate everything smoothly. I still have some salad oil in the kitchen  cupboard. Is that something?'    The screens that represent her eyes turn purple, then blue and pink. The shades flow  together slowly and softly, and she laughs a tinny robotic smile, one where all the syllables are spoken with a short pause in between. Ha -ha-ha.   “Nice joke, Henry. Will you dance along?' Robbie stops moving and turns her head back in the right direction. Her body is buzzing.    And then, just when I think she's going on standby because her battery is running low, music  plays.
