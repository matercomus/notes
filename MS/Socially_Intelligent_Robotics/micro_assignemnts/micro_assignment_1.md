**Pick one specific problem related to “modeling and recognizing social aspects of humans” and sketch what an AI solution to this problem could look like (around 5 sentences).**

**Problems:**
- Modeling something that is super complex (emotions) and not well understood will likely result in a subpar model
	- so important to decide which accepts are most important and focus there.
- Also no one model because people differ in the way they exhibit and perceive emotions.

The chosen problem is the variability in how individuals express and perceive emotions. To address this, an AI solution could be developed as follows:

1. **Identify Desirable Traits:** Collaborate with experts in relevant fields to identify desirable personality traits and behaviors for the specific application. These traits will form the basis for the model’s requirements.

2. **Model Creation and Testing:** Develop a model based on these requirements and test it with a group representative of the target audience. Use surveys and observational studies to assess how well the model aligns with the pre-established requirements. Update the requirements as necessary based on new insights.

3. **Public Testing:** Once a stable model is established, incorporate it into a publicly accessible tool for broader testing. This allows for further refinement based on feedback and data collected from a more diverse user base.

4. **Implementation and Continuous Evaluation:** Deploy the model in a production environment while continuously evaluating its performance. Regular updates should be made to ensure the model remains effective and relevant.
