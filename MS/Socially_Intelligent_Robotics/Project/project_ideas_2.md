# SIR Project ideas refined

## 6. Expressing Empathy
**Interaction Problem**: How can a robot effectively express empathy towards users?
**Interaction Goal**: Develop an interaction where the NAO robot can understand and respond to the emotional state of the user, providing empathetic responses that make the user feel understood and comforted.
**Specific Scope**: Develop an interaction where the NAO robot can recognize and respond to basic emotional states such as happiness, sadness, and anger. The robot should be able to provide empathetic responses that are appropriate for the detected emotion.

## 7. Using Humor to Engage Users
**Interaction Problem**: How can a robot effectively use humor to engage users?
**Interaction Goal**: Design an interaction where the NAO robot uses humor appropriately in conversation, aiming to increase user engagement and enjoyment.
**Specific Scope**: Design an interaction where the NAO robot uses humor in response to specific prompts or situations. The humor should be appropriate and non-offensive, and it should aim to increase user engagement and enjoyment.

## 11. Gesture Recognition
**Interaction Problem**: How can a robot effectively recognize and interpret human gestures?
**Interaction Goal**: Develop a system where the NAO robot can accurately recognize and interpret human gestures, improving its interaction capabilities.
**Specific Scope**: Develop a system where the NAO robot can accurately recognize and interpret a set of predefined human gestures, such as waving, pointing, or nodding. This could be used to facilitate non-verbal communication with the robot.

## 12. Voice Modulation
**Interaction Problem**: How can a robot modulate its voice to convey different emotions or intentions?
**Interaction Goal**: Design an interaction where the NAO robot modulates its voice to match the emotional content of its messages, enhancing user engagement.
**Specific Scope**: Design an interaction where the NAO robot modulates its voice to convey different emotions in response to specific prompts or situations. The robot should be able to express emotions such as happiness, sadness, and surprise through changes in its voice tone and pitch.

## 13. Interactive Storytelling
**Interaction Problem**: How can a robot engage children in interactive storytelling?
**Interaction Goal**: Develop an interaction where the NAO robot tells interactive stories, adapting the narrative based on the child's reactions.
**Specific Scope**: Develop an interaction where the NAO robot tells a short interactive story, adapting the narrative based on the child's reactions. The story should be engaging and suitable for children of a specific age group.

## 25. Stress Relief Companion
**Interaction Problem**: How can a robot help users relieve stress?
**Interaction Goal**: Design an interaction where the NAO robot engages users in stress-relieving activities such as meditation or listening to calming music.
**Specific Scope**: Design an interaction where the NAO robot guides users through a short meditation session or plays calming music upon request. The robot should be able to recognize when a user is stressed and suggest appropriate stress-relieving activities.

## 26. Sign Language Interpreter
**Interaction Problem**: How can a robot effectively recognize and interpret sign language, aiding communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not?
**Interaction Goal**: Develop a system where the NAO robot can accurately recognize and interpret sign language, translating it into spoken language for those unfamiliar with sign language, and vice versa. This could be particularly useful in educational settings or for individuals with speaking or hearing impairments. The system could also include a feature to assist individuals in learning sign language.
**Specific Scope**: Develop a system where the NAO robot can accurately recognize and interpret a set of basic sign language gestures, translating them into spoken language for those unfamiliar with sign language. This could be particularly useful for facilitating communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not.
