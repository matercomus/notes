(Wright, 1932)

- Envisage a population with $n$ traits as existing in a $n+1$-dimensional space (landscape) with height corresponding to fitness
- Each different individual (phenotype) represents a single point on the landscape
- Population is therefore a "cloud" of points, moving on the landscape over time as it evolves (adaptation)

- Selection "pushes" population up the landscape
- Genetic drift:
	- random variations in feature distribution
	- (+ or -) arising from sampling error
	- can cause the population "melt down" hills, thus crossing valleys and leaving local optima
