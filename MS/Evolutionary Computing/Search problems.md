- Simulation is different from optimization/modelling 
- Optimization/modelling problems search through huge space of possibilities
- Search space: collection of all objects of interest including the desired solution
- Question: how large is the search space of different tours through n cities?

### Problems vs. problem-solvers

Thereâ€™s a distinction between:
- search problems, which define search spaces, and
- problem-solvers, which move through search spaces to find a solution.
