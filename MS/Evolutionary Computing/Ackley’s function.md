The **Ackley function** is a popular test problem for optimization algorithms, particularly in the field of Evolutionary Computation (EC).

## Definition

The Ackley function is defined over the n-dimensional real space (ℝ^n) and maps to the real numbers (ℝ). It has a large number of local minima but only one global minimum at x = 0 with value = 0.

## Characteristics

In its two-dimensional form, the Ackley function is characterized by a nearly flat outer region and a large hole at the center. This makes it a challenging problem for optimization algorithms, particularly hill-climbing algorithms, as they can easily get trapped in one of its many local minima.

## Usage

The Ackley function is widely used in EC and other global optimization techniques due to its complex landscape with many local optima. It provides a rigorous test bed for assessing the performance of these algorithms.

## History

The function was proposed by David Ackley in his 1987 PhD dissertation.
