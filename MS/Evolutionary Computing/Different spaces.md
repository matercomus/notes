# Different Spaces in Evolutionary Algorithms

## Genotype Space

The genotype space is the set of representable solutions. It is always present in a **genetic algorithm**.

## Phenotype Space

The phenotype space represents the objects coded by the genotype. It is always present in a **genetic algorithm**, and it **may be equal to the genotype space**. The neighbourhood structure may bear little relation with the genotype space.

## Fitness Space

The fitness space is present if a quantifiable fitness is given. It represents the space of fitness values, which are (multi-dimensional) real numbers.

## Algorithmic Space

The algorithmic space is present if a spatially structured EA is used. It represents the structure of the population and is akin to the geographical space on which life on earth has evolved.

Please note that distance in these spaces may (and will) differ.
