### EAs and domain knowledge
- Trend in the 90’s: adding problem specific knowledge to EAs
	- (special variation operators, repair, etc)
- Result: EA performance curve “deformation”: 
	- better on problems of the given type
	- worse on problems different from given type
	- amount of added knowledge is variable
 
- Theory suggests the search for an “all-purpose” algorithm may be fruitless.
