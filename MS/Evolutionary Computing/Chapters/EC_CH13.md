# Constraint Handling

## Overview
- **[[Motivation]] and the trouble**
- **[[Definition of a constrained problem]]**
- **[[Constraint handling in Evolutionary Algorithms]] (EAs)**

## Important points
- Constraints are "everywhere"
- FOP - CSP - COP Scheme
- Indirect constraint handling: make it an objective BEFORE the EA is applied
- Direct constraint handling: take care of it DURING the EA run
