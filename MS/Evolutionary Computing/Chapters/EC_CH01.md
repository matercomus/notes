## Chapter 1: Problems to be solved

Problems can be classified in different ways:
- [[Black box model]] 
- [[Search problems]]
- [[Optimization vs constraint satisfaction]]
- [[NP problems]]

## Important points
- Optimization – modeling – simulation scheme
- FOP – COP – CSP scheme
- Problem hardness scheme (based on solver properties)
- Other schemes exist, e.g., by the type of variables (continuous vs. discrete)

## Questions/Exercises
How can we formulate the 8-queens problem as a FOP/CSP/COP? What are the objective functions? What are the constraints? How can we mix them?
