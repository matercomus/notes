## Chapter 2 â€“ The Origins

>Evolution is the theory of how one form of life changes into another,
>NOT the theory of how life originated.
>So in order to test evolution we need to start with a living organism.
### Roots
- Evolution
- Genetics
- Computers

### Main Topics
- [[Motivation for evolutionary computing]]
- [[History]]
- [[Darwinian Evolution]]
- [[Adaptive Landscape Metaphor]]
- [[Genetics]]

### Important points
- Several historical 'dialects' in EV, ex:
	- [[Genetic Algorithm]]
	- [[Evolution Strategy]]
	- [[Evolutionary Programming]]
	- [[Genetic Programming]]
	- ...
- **Umbrella term** for the principal algorithm: **Evolutionary Algorithm**
- Name of the field: Evolutionary Computing/Computation
- Enveloping fields: bio-inspired computing, natural computing, computational intelligence, artificial intelligence
- Biological inspiration & terminology
- Not necessarily biologically plausible
	- Bio-chemical grounding is missing (matter matters!)
	- Simplified mechanisms
	- Biologically impossible or non-existing mechanisms are OK for applications
