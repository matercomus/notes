# Important Points

## Selection
- Selection increases quality but decreases diversity.
- Selection can occur at two places in the evolutionary loop:
    - Parent selection
    - Survivor selection
- Most selection operators can be used for both purposes.
## Selection Pressure
- Selection pressure is an important feature of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs).
- Strong selection leads to fast convergence, possibly to a local optimum.
- Weak selection leads to slow progress, almost like a random walk.
## Diversity
- Maintaining diversity is important in EAs.
- There are specific mechanisms for preserving diversity in EAs.
