# Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms

- [[Non-EC Approaches]]
- [[EC approaches]]

# Important Points

- Multi-objective problems occur very frequently 
- Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are very good in solving multi-objective problems
- Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are one of the most successful EC subareas
- The number of objectives is typically low in practice and research, current State of the Art is about 2 or 3, more than 3 are seen as "many-objective" problems
