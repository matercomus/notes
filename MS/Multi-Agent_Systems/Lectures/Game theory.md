# Game Theory: The Science of Strategic Thinking

- Game Theory is the science of strategic thinking.
- It was originally a tool in economics.
- The concept was introduced by von Neumann & Morgenstern in their work, "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior", in 1944.
- The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded for work in Game Theory in the years 1994 (to J. Harsanyi, J.Nash and R. Selten), 2005 (to R. Aumann and T. Schelling), 2007 (to L. Hurwicz, E. Maskin and R. Myerson), 2012 (to A. Roth and L. Shapley), 2014 (to J. Tirole), and 2020 (to P.R. Milgrom and R.B. Wilson).
- Game Theory provides a level of abstraction appropriate to study a wide range of socio-economic, political, and even biological phenomena.

## Examples of Interesting Games

(You didn't provide any examples, but I'm sure they were interesting!)

## Different Points of View
- Philosopher John Elster (1982) stated that if one accepts that interaction is the essence of social life, then game theory provides solid micro foundations for the study of social structure and social change.
- Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis questioned in their book "Game Theory. A critical Introduction" (1995) whether game theory simply repeats what everyone already knows in a language that no one understands.

- Game Theory (GT) is the mathematical study of interaction among independent, self-interested agents.
- Self-interest implies that each agent has its own interests and preferences (aims, goals); agents tend to have (partially) conflicting interests; these interests are reflected in (numerical) utilities that are consistent with the preferences; if option A is preferred to B, then u(A)>u(B).
- Agents act to maximize their utility.
- There are two types of GT: Coalitional/Cooperative vs non-coalitional/non-cooperative GT.

## Ingredients of Interesting Games
- Players: You against one or more opponent(s).
- Opponent: other agents, other version of yourself, nature, lady luck, etc.
- Rules determine which actions can be taken, and what the corresponding pay-offs or utilities are; actions and pay-offs are exogenous variables.
- Maximize your pay-off: Everyone wants to win!
- Competition and collaboration: individuals or teams (non-cooperative and cooperative GT).


## Cooperative versus Non-Cooperative Games
- **Non-Cooperative Games**: These involve selfish individuals who only consider their own interest and do not coordinate their actions in groups. Coordination might happen as an "accident" of selfish behaviour. Agreements need to be self-enforcing (no "contracts"!).
- **Cooperative Games**: Binding commitments ("contracts") allow groups of players to coordinate their actions. There are two types:
  - **Non-transferable utility**: The pay-off of each individual increases! An example is the Stable marriage problem.
  - **Transferable utility**: A fair way to divide the additional value (e.g. money) generated by collaboration needs to be found. An example is the Shapley value.

## Simultaneous vs. Sequential Games
- **Simultaneous games**: Players make their moves simultaneously, i.e., without knowing what the other players will do!
	- Examples include Rock-paper-scissors and Sealed bid auctions.
- **Sequential games**: These involve a sequence of successive moves by players who can see each other's moves.
	- Examples include Chess, Card games, and Open cry auctions.
