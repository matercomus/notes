1. **Pay-off Matrix**

|   | 1 (B) | 2 (B) |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 (A) | -2, 2 | 3, -3 |
| 2 (A) | 3, -3 | -4, 4 |

2. **Regret Minimisation Strategies in terms of Pure Strategies**

#For Player A:
- If A chooses 1, the worst outcome is -2 (if B chooses 1). 
- If A chooses 2, the worst outcome is -4 (if B chooses 2). 
So, A should choose 1 to minimise regret.

For Player B:
- If B chooses 1, the worst outcome is -3 (if A chooses 2). 
- If B chooses 2, the worst outcome is -3 (if A chooses 1). 
So, B is indifferent between 1 and 2.

3. **Regret Minimisation Strategies in terms of Mixed Strategies**

In this game, both players can randomise their strategies to minimise regret. The optimal mixed strategy can be found by solving a system of equations, but without additional information, it's not possible to provide a specific answer.

4. **Safety Strategies for Each Player in terms of Pure Strategies**

For Player A:
- If A chooses 1, the best outcome is 3 (if B chooses 2). 
- If A chooses 2, the best outcome is 3 (if B chooses 1). 
So, A is indifferent between 1 and 2.

For Player B:
- If B chooses 1, the best outcome is 2 (if A chooses 1). 
- If B chooses 2, the best outcome is 4 (if A chooses 2). 
So, B should choose 2 to maximise safety.

5. **Safety Strategies for Each Player in terms of Mixed Strategies**

Similar to the regret minimisation strategies, both players can randomise their strategies to maximise safety. The optimal mixed strategy can be found by solving a system of equations, but without additional information, it's not possible to provide a specific answer.
