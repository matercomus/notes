# Evolutionary Computing Chapter 9: Working with Evolutionary Algorithms


- **Algorithm Testing**: This process must be based on many problems and many runs. Itâ€™s crucial to never draw any conclusion from a single run. Instead, perform a sufficient number of independent runs and use statistical measures like averages and standard deviations.

- **Test Suite**: A good test suite is crucial for effective algorithm testing. It should include classic functions, modern hard objective functions, and problem instances made by random generator. The choice of test problems has severe implications on the generalizability and scope of the results.

- **Statistics**: Good statistics are key to understanding the results. Use statistical measures and tests to assess the reliability of conclusions. Tools like R or Octave can be used for statistical analysis.

- **Performance Measures**: These generally include algorithm speed (efficiency), solution quality (efficacy), and robustness (insensitivity). The priorities can depend on various factors such as purpose, type of application, and budget.

- **Findings**: Scope your findings and strive for generalizable findings. Be careful about the relevance and generalizability of your results.

- **Algorithm Specification**: Fully specify your algorithm including design of representation, mutation operators, recombination operators, selection methods, initialization method, and termination criterion.

- **Open Source, Open Science**: Embrace open source and open science principles. Publish your code for reproducibility of results and data for external validation.
