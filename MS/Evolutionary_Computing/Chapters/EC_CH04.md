### Important points:
- Representation is essential when designing an EA
- A few data structures are enough to represent many (all?) problems, e.g., binary, integer, real-valued vectors, trees
- For any given problem there can be more suitable representations. Some are better than others â€“ remember the strong causality principle !  
- Reproduction operators must fit the representation
- Reproduction operators are stochastic
- Reproduction operators can be distinguished by arity
	- Unary: mutation
	- Binary: recombination, crossover
	- N-ary: multi-parent recombination
- Self-adaptive mutation is a powerful mechanism. But remember to change the sigma **first**!
