# Population Management

Two different population management models exist:
- **Generational model**
  - Each individual survives for exactly one generation
  - The entire set of parents is replaced by the offspring

- **Steady-state model**
  - A few new individuals (children) are generated per generation
  - A few old members of the population are replaced

- **Generation Gap**
  - The proportion of the population replaced
  - Parameter, value  
    - $= 1.0$ means Generational EA  
    - $< 1.0$ means Steady State EA
