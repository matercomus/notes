## What is Hybridization?
Hybridization is the combination of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with another type (or types) of problem-solving heuristic.

## Why use Hybridisation?
There are several reasons why one might choose to use hybridisation:
- **Improving EA Search**: One might be looking to improve the EA's ability to search for good solutions.
- **Improving Existing Techniques**: Rather than reinventing the wheel, one might want to improve upon existing techniques.
- **Part of a Larger System**: One might want to incorporate the EA as part of a larger system.
