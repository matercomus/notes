# Multimodality

Most interesting problems have more than one locally optimal solution.
## Genetic Drift

Genetic drift is a phenomenon in genetic algorithms where a finite population with global mixing (e.g., panmictic system, where everybody can mate with everybody) implies that the population eventually converges around one optimum. 

However, we often might want to identify several possible peaks. A sub-optimum can be more attractive, for example, if it's more stable or easier to make/manufacture.
