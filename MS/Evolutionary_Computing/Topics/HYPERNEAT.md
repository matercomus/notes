Creating a neural network with a Compositional Pattern Producing Network (CPPN) involves using one neural network to generate another. The coordinates of neurons are used as input to the CPPN.

This method allows for the creation of neural networks with multiple layers.

The design of the substrate, or the space where queries are applied, can be adapted to the geometry of the problem.

One of the advantages of this method is that there is no upper bound on substrate resolution. In other words, a connectivity concept is infinite in resolution.
