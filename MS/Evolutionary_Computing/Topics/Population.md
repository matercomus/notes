- Role: holds the candidate solutions of the problem as individuals (genotypes).

- Formally, a population is a multi-set of individuals, i.e., the same element might occur multiple times.
- Population is the basic unit of evolution, i.e., the population is evolving, not the individuals.

- Selection operators act on population level.
- Variation operators act on individual level.


- Some sophisticated EAs also assert a spatial structure on the population e.g., a grid
- Selection operators usually take whole population into account i.e., reproductive probabilities are relative to current generation
- Diversity of a population refers to the number of different fitness values / phenotypes / genotypes present (note: not the same thing)
