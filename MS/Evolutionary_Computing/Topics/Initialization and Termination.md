### Initialization
- Usually done at random, 
	- Need to ensure even spread and mixture of possible alleles (values)
	- Can include existing solutions, or use problem-specific heuristics, to “seed” the population
### Termination
- condition checked every generation, ex: Reaching some ...
	-  (known/hoped for) fitness level
	-  maximum number of generations
	-  minimum level of diversity
	-  specified number of generations without fitness improvement (stagnation)
