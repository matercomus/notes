# Memes and Memetic Algorithms
## Memetic Algorithm

### What is a Memetic Algorithm?
A Memetic Algorithm is the combination of an Evolutionary Algorithm with Local Search Operators that work within the EA loop. This term also applies to EAs that use instance-specific knowledge in operators. Memetic Algorithms have been shown to be orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than EAs on some problems, and are considered the state of the art on many problems.

## Meme

A meme is the newest "self-replicator" on Earth. It represents that which is being imitated, or information copied from person to person.
