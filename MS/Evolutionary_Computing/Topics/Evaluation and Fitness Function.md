### Role
- Represents the task to solve, the requirements to adapt to (can be seen as “the environment”)
- Enables selection (provides basis for comparison)
- If some phenotypic traits are advantageous, desirable, e.g., big ears cool better, then these traits are rewarded by more offspring that will expectedly carry the same trait

- A.k.a. quality function or objective function
- Assigns a single real-valued fitness to each phenotype which forms the basis for selection
	- So the more discrimination (different values) the better
- Typically we talk about fitness being maximized
	- Some problems may be best posed as minimization problems, but conversion is trivial
