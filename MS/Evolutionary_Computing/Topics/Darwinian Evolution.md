## Survival of the fittest

- All environments have finite resources
  (i.e., can only support a limited number of individuals)
- Life forms have basic instinct/ life cycles geared towards reproduction
- Therefore some kind of selection is inevitable
- Those individuals that compete for the resources most effectively have increased chance of reproduction

- Note: fitness in natural evolution is a derived, secondary measure
	i.e., we (humans) assign a high fitness to individuals with many offspring.

## Diversity drives change

- Phenotypic traits:
	- Physical & behavioral differences that affect response to environment.
	- Partly determined by :
		- inheritance (nature)
		- factors during development (nurture)
	- Unique to each individual, partly as a result of random changes
- If Phenotypic changes lead to:
	- higher chance of reproduction
	- Can be inherited
- Then they will tend to increase in subsequent generations, leading to new combinations of traits

>If you have variation,
>heredity, and selection, then
>you must get evolution

## Summary
- Population consists of diverse set of individuals
- Combinations of traits that are better adapted tend to increase representation in population (Individuals are "units of selection")
- Variations occur through random changes yielding constant source of diversity, coupled with selection that means: Population is the "unit of evolution"
- Note the absence of "guiding force"
