- Remember the one regarding the evolution of intelligence 
	- this is “high level”
- There is another one regarding (heuristic) problem solving 
	- this is more practical

- Developing, analyzing, applying problem solving methods a.k.a. algorithms is a central theme in mathematics and computer science
	- Time for thorough problem analysis decreases
	- Complexity of problems to be solved increases
	- Consequence: ROBUST PROBLEM SOLVING technology needed, i.e., algorithms that work on a wide range of problems without much problem specific adjustment.

- Nature has always served as a source of inspiration for engineers and scientists
	- The **best problem solver** known in nature is:
		- The **(human) brain** that created “the wheel, New York, wars and so on” 
			(after Douglas Adams’ Hitch-Hikers Guide)
		- The **evolution** mechanism that created the human brain 
			(after Darwin’s Origin of Species)
		- Answer 1: Neurocomputing
			- A type of computing that makes use of neural networks. It’s affiliated with the philosophical tradition known as Computational theory of mind, also referred to as computationalism, which advances the thesis that neural computation explains cognition.
		- Answer 2: Evolutionary Computing
			- A family of algorithms for global optimization inspired by biological evolution. It’s a subfield of artificial intelligence and soft computing that studies these algorithms.
