### Role: Causes small, random variations
- Acts on one genotype and delivers another
- Element of randomness is essential and differentiates it from other heuristic operators
- Importance ascribed depends on representation and historical dialect:
	- Binary [[Genetic Algorithms]] (GA) – background operator responsible for preserving and introducing diversity
	- [[Evolutionary Programming]] (EP) – only search operator
	- [[Genetic Programming]] (GP) – hardly used
- May guarantee connectedness of search space and hence convergence.
