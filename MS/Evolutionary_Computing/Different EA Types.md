- Historically different flavors of EAs have been associated with different data types to represent solutions
	- Binary strings : [[Genetic Algorithms]]
	- Real-valued vectors : [[Evolution Strategies]]
	- Finite State Machines: [[Evolutionary Programming]]
	- LISP trees: [[Genetic Programming]]
 
- These historical differences are largely irrelevant, best strategy: 
	- choose representation to suit problem
	- choose variation operators to suit representation
 
- Selection operators only use fitness and so are independent of representation.
