# Future Outlook and Culture Changes in Evolutionary Computation

## Future Outlook

- **Hybrid methods for A & B**: The future may see the development of hybrid methods that optimize both the number of vectors tested and the number of tests per vector.
- **Well-funded EA performance measures, multi-objective formulation**: This could lead to the development of multi-objective tuner algorithms.
- **(Statistical) models of the utility landscape**: This would provide more knowledge about parameters.
- **Open source toolboxes, distributed execution, and good testbeds**: These resources could facilitate the development and testing of new methods.
- **Adoption by the EC community**: As these methods prove their worth, they may be adopted more widely within the EC community.
- **Rollout to other heuristic methods with parameters**: The techniques developed for EAs could also be applied to other heuristic methods that have parameters.

## Culture Change

- **Fast and good tuning can lead to new attitude**: As tuning methods become more efficient and effective, this could lead to a shift in attitudes within the EC community.
- **Past & present: robust EAs preferred, Future: problem-specific EAs preferred**: There may be a shift from preferring robust EAs that work well on a wide range of problems, to preferring problem-specific EAs that are tuned to work exceptionally well on a specific problem.
- **Old question: what is better the GA or the ES? New question: what symbolic configuration is best?**: The focus may shift from comparing different types of EAs to comparing different configurations of a single type of EA.
- **New attitude/practice: tuning efforts are measured and reported, EAs with their practical best settings are compared, instead of unmotivated “magical” settings**: There may be a move towards more transparency and rigor in reporting tuning efforts and comparing EAs.
