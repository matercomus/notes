## Motivation

### Why bother about constraints?
- **Practical relevance**: A great deal of practical problems are constrained.
- **Theoretical challenge**: A great deal of intractable problems (NP-hard etc.) are constrained.

### Why try with evolutionary algorithms?
- EAs show a good ratio of (implementation) effort/performance.
- EAs are acknowledged as good solvers for tough problems.
