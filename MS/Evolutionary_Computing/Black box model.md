The “Black box” model consists of 3 components. When one component is unknown, it results in a new problem type.
#### Optimization
In this model, the desired ==output is known==, and the ==task is to find inputs==. 

Examples include:
- Time tables for university, call center, or hospital
- Design specifications
- Traveling salesman problem (TSP)
- Eight-queens problem, etc.
##### Examples: 
- **University Timetabling**
	This involves an enormously big search space. Timetables must be good and feasible. The definition of “good” is determined by a number of competing criteria.
- **Satellite Structure**
	This involves optimizing satellite designs for NASA to maximize vibration isolation. The fitness of the design is determined by its vibration resistance.

#### Modelling
==We have== corresponding sets of ==inputs & outputs== and ==seek a model== that delivers correct output for every known input. Note that modelling problems can be transformed into optimization problems.
##### Example: 
- **Load Applicant Credibility**
	A British bank evolved a credibility model to predict loan paying behavior of new applicants.

#### Simulation
==We have a== given ==model== and ==wish to know the outputs== that arise ==under different input== conditions. This is often used to answer “what-if” questions in evolving dynamic environments.
##### Examples: 
- **Evolving Artificial Societies**
	This involves simulating trade, economic competition, etc. to calibrate models and use these models to optimize strategies and policies.
- **Evolving Wind Turbine Blades**
	“That solution is really clever. That’s ingenious. And there was no designer to this blade, it just evolved.”
- **Biological Interpretations**
	Incest prevention keeps evolution from rapid degeneration (we knew this). Multi-parent reproduction makes evolution more efficient (this does not exist on Earth in carbon).
