- EAs fall into the category of generate-and-test algorithms, a.k.a. trial-and-error algorithms
- They are stochastic, population-based search algorithms

- For most problems, a problem-specific tool may:
	- perform better than a generic search algorithm on most instances
	- have limited utility
	- not do well on all instances
 
- EAs are meant to provide a robust tool that shows:
	- evenly good performance 
	- over a range of problems and instances
