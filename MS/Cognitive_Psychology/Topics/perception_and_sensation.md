# Sensation and Perception

## Sensation

- **Sensation** is the registration of a physical stimulus by receptive neurons.
- It’s a physical, factual thing, not susceptible to interpretation.
- Examples include the activation of 
	- the olfactory bulb (smell) or 
	- the visual cortex (sight).
 
## Vision

- **Fovea (1°)**: Many cones, sharp vision (high acuity), color vision, lower sensitivity)
- **Parafovea (6-8°)**: Mix of cones and rods.
- **Perifovea (>8°)**: Mostly rods, low acuity, no color vision, more sensitivity.

## Perception

- **Perception** is the process of interpreting sensations.
- Examples include smelling and interpreting, recognizing, understanding (‘what is it?’) and interacting with the world (‘How to respond?’).

## The Thin Line Between Sensation and Perception

- The pupillary light response is not just triggered by incoming light but also by thinking about bright objects.

## The Core Challenge in Perception

- The core challenge in perception is to resolve ambiguity.
- This is known as the **inverse projection problem**. From sensory processing alone we cannot say anything conclusive about the world!
