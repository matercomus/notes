# Memory: Sensory, Short-Term, and Working Memory

Memory is any way in which a past experience affects future thoughts or behaviors. It can be conceptualized into various stages: sensory memory, short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory (LTM).

## Sensory Memory

Sensory memory is akin to sensation. It’s the neural activity caused by a sensation that doesn’t turn off like a light switch but decays over time. Our senses register a lot of information, but only part of it is consciously processed or enters STM, which is also known as attentional orienting.

For example, when seeing 12 letters for 50ms, people reported 4-5 letters. However, when these letters were followed by a cue for the top, mid, or bottom row, people reported 3-4 letters from that row. This shows that short-lived sensory memory registers most of the information that hits our visual receptors, but this information decays within less than a second.

## Short-Term Memory (STM)

STM is the first stage where we can proactively retain things. The limit of STM can be framed not just in terms of the number of objects but also in terms of the amount of information.

Some item types are more difficult to remember than others. STM involves not just actively memorizing stuff but also performing tasks that require memory.

## Working Memory
Working memory, introduced by Baddeley & Hitch in 1974, involves “slave systems” and a “central processor”.

The central processor recruits slave systems to encode, maintain and retrieve information, distributes mental resources when multitasking, prevents irrelevant information from entering working memory, and coordinates higher cognitive operations.

The visuo-spatial sketchpad is a component of working memory that provides a ‘space’ to navigate in with attention. Attention can be moved within this working memory space, allowing for the manipulation of information in working memory.

## Memory in the Brain

Sensory memory corresponds to residual activity in early perceptual regions of the brain. Various regions of the brain have been associated with each component of working memory, with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) playing a key role. The PFC coordinates activation in perceptual regions during retention. So memories are ‘stored’ or at least read out in perceptual areas like the visual cortex too.

In conclusion, memory involves various stages and components that interact with each other and with our perceptual processes to affect our future thoughts and behaviors.
