# Long-Term Memory: An Infinite Archive of Experiences

Long-term memory (LTM) is the seemingly infinite archive into which we have stored every experience since our existence. It’s different from short-term memory (STM) and working memory (WM) in terms of its capacity, duration, and the type of information it stores.

## What is LTM?

LTM stores a vast amount of information for an indefinite period. This includes our experiences, skills, knowledge, and much more. For example, the taste and smell of chewing on a desk or the sound of a familiar word are all stored in LTM.

## Types of LTM

Long-term memory (LTM) can be divided into several types, each serving a different purpose and storing a different kind of information:

1. **Implicit Memory** (a.k.a. Procedural): This type of LTM involves **skills** and **routine** procedures that are **performed automatically**. These are the memories of skills and routines that we perform without conscious thought, like **riding a bike** or **typing on a keyboard**.

1. **Explicit Memory**: This type of LTM involves conscious, intentional recollection of factual information, previous experiences, and concepts. Explicit memory can be further divided into two subtypes:

	- **Episodic Memory**: This subtype involves our ability to recall specific **events** or **experiences**. These memories are often very detailed and can include information about the time and place the event occurred. For example, remembering your first day at school or your wedding day.
 
	- **Semantic Memory**: This subtype involves our ability to remember **facts** and **general knowledge**. These memories are not tied to personal events or experiences. For example, knowing that Paris is the capital of France or that a cat is an animal.

These various types of LTM work together to allow us to interact with the world around us, recall past experiences, learn new information, and plan for the future.
## Interaction Between WM and LTM

Information in LTM is constantly re-activated by the things that we keep in WM. This information in turn bolsters whatever is kept in WM. For example, the meaning of words, relevant past events, and goals.

An experiment without patients, known as the serial position curve, demonstrates this interaction. In this experiment, subjects are briefly presented with a list of words one-by-one (e.g., tree – laptop – sphinx – earbud – mouse – lamp – pocket). When asked to recall as many words as possible, subjects report the first and last words best. This phenomenon can be explained by two effects:

- **Primacy Effect (first word advantage)**: The first words get full attention; STM is not occupied by other things, and/or words were rehearsed for a longer amount of time.
- **Recency Effect (last word advantage)**: The last words are still in STM.

Neither STM nor LTM can account for both these effects simultaneously, suggesting that we need both types of memory.

There are also cases of patients who demonstrate the distinction between STM and LTM. For example, Clive Wearing had an impaired LTM but his STM was ‘alright’. He displayed good knowledge about many things but forgot things that happened 3 minutes prior. On the other hand, there was a patient who didn’t know the meanings of words anymore and didn’t recognize close relatives (indicating impaired semantic memory), but could recount the previous day, week, or year (indicating intact episodic memory).

These examples highlight the complex interplay between WM and LTM and how they contribute to our ability to process and remember information.

## How Does LTM Work in the Brain?

The **hippocampus** in the **medial temporal lobe** is strongly involved in memory tasks. When people are deprived of sleep, memories don’t stick as well. This suggests that sleep plays a crucial role in the consolidation of memories.

The process of consolidation involves **cortical neurons** activating associated hippocampal cells. These hippocampal cells later re-activate the cortical cells, allowing the connection in the **neocortex** to strengthen. The cortical association is consolidated (**Long-Term Potentiation**), while the hippocampal connection is allowed to deteriorate.

Both LTM and STM involve perceptual regions of the brain. When you memorize a visual, it’s akin to ‘simulating’ seeing something. However, there are differences in how these types of memory operate.

## Implicit Learning and Memory

Implicit learning is a type of learning that occurs without conscious awareness. It’s related to procedural memory, a type of long-term memory involved in learning motor skills. Implicit learning can lead to robust memories that can be difficult to describe but can strongly influence behavior.

In the context of neural activity, implicit learning involves changes at the level of single neurons. With repeated activation, there is a chemical change at the synapse, the junction between two neurons. This change strengthens the synaptic transfer, leading to faster processing. For example, stronger connections can form between letters and words through repeated exposure and practice.

In conclusion, while STM and LTM both involve perceptual regions of the brain, they differ in their capacity, duration, and the type of information they store. Implicit learning and memory consolidation are key processes that contribute to our ability to learn and remember information over the long term.
