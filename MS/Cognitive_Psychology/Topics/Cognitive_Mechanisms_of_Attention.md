# Cognitive Mechanisms of Attention

## Neuronal Activity
![[neuron_img.png]]
Neurons have thresholds for when to fire. The more a neuron is excited (the more input it receives via its dendrites), the more frequently it will fire action potentials. 

Some connections are inhibitory rather than excitatory. For example, neurons coding for one part of the visual field may suppress neurons coding for another part when a significant event occurs. 

Signals sent by the excited neurons will enter conscious awareness (frontal brain regions) faster.

## Exogenous vs Endogenous Attention

- **Exogenous Attention**: Strong sensory input tips the balance in terms of the ‘neuron battle’. This means that external stimuli can influence which neurons fire.
- **Endogenous Attention**: Higher-order neurons suppress or excite neurons at the level of perception. 
	This is a form of bottom-up and top-down interaction, where the biasing of low-level detectors by higher levels is a form of endogenous attention.
