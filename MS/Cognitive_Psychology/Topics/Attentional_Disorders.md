Hemispatial neglect is a condition in which, after damage to one hemisphere of the brain, a deficit in attention to and awareness of one side of the field of vision is observed. Itâ€™s as if one side of the world has disappeared.

In all these tasks, one side (hemifield) is ignored, even though the patient can see things in that hemifield when attention is forcefully directed to it. This condition is often caused by a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in one hemisphere of the brain.
