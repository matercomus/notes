# Attention in Reading
The process of reading involves starting to process a word even before looking at it. This is due to the limits imposed by visual acuity, which allows us to get some letters and visual cues such as word length (Rayner: preview benefit).

## Visuo-Spatial Attention

Our visuo-spatial attention is not confined to the word at which we look directly. Covert attention moves ahead of the eyes to the next word, or maybe attention was directed at multiple words from the start.

## Debate about Attention in Reading
There’s a longstanding debate about whether only one word is attended at a time (Rayner & co.) or maybe not (Joshua & others).

### Serial Processing of Words

In the flankers lexical decision task, it was found that we cannot prevent ourselves from processing the flankers, suggesting that there might be only sub-lexical orthographic processing.

### Tracking Covert Attention

To track covert attention during reading, researchers vary the brightness of flanker locations. The target recognition speed is influenced by words on the left and right but not above and below.

## Processing Multiple Words
Evidence suggests that readers process multiple words in parallel. For example, ‘man’ is recognized faster in ‘the man can run’ than in ‘run man the can’.

## Flexibility in Reading
Our expectations constrain the mapping of words onto locations. For example, ‘baby dog eats meat’ and ‘baby eats dog meat’ are processed differently.

## Unsolved Questions
There are still unsolved questions about how word position coding works, when it happens, and what factors influence it.
