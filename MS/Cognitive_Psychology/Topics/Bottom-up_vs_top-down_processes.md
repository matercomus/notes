# Bottom-up vs Top-down Processing
	![[bottom_up_img_1.png]]
- **Bottom-up processing**: This is driven by the sensory organs which provide activation of ‘low’ cortical regions, cascading to ‘higher’ regions. It’s often associated with sensation.
	![[top_down_img_1.png]]
- **Top-down processing**: This involves ‘higher’ regions influencing the activation of ‘lower’ regions. It’s a key component of perception.

In summary, while **sensation** is primarily a **bottom-up** process, 
**perception** is a **mixture** of both **bottom-up** and **top-down** processing. 

This interplay allows us to interpret and make sense of the world around us.

# Bottom-up Processing: Perceptual Organization

- **Bottom-up processing** is not just about sensation. It also involves the grouping of local features into global structures, which seems to proceed automatically.

## Gestalt Principles

- Gestalt principles are a set of assumptions about things that happen in an automatic, bottom-up fashion. They are considered a mere product of the system’s architecture.
- These principles include:

| similarity                       | proximity                      | symmetry                      | closure                       | continuity                      | common fate                      |

## Life Experiences and Bottom-up Processing

- Not all effects attributed to bottom-up processes may be purely bottom-up. Our life experiences bolster the expectation that:
    - Similar-looking things belong together.
    - Objects are most often symmetrical.

These experiences can influence our perception, suggesting that perception is a mixture of both bottom-up and top-down processing.


# Top-down Processing

- **Top-down processing** is typically conceptualized as processing in the brain that involves various levels of processing and interactions among these levels.

## Word-Superiority Effect
- The **word-superiority effect**, proposed by James McKeen Cattell in 1886, is an example of top-down processing. This effect suggests that a letter is recognized faster if it is in a word than if it is in a non-sensical string. 
- For example, the letter ‘P’ would be recognized faster in the word **‘PLUMP’** than in the scrambled string **‘PMULP’**.

## Predictive Coding
- **Predictive coding** is another way to frame the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processing. It’s considered by some as a grand unifying theory of the mind. 
- This theory suggests that the brain is constantly making predictions about incoming sensory information and uses errors in these predictions to update its model of the world.

In summary, top-down processing plays a crucial role in our perception and understanding of the world, influencing how we interpret sensory information based on our expectations and prior knowledge.
