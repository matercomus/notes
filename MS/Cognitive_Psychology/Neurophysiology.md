# Neurophysiology: Perception in the Brain

## Brain Areas

It’s important to understand that perception in the brain is **not** about isolated brain areas. 
Each area of the brain works in conjunction with others to process information.

## Dorsal and Ventral Pathways

In neurophysiology, we often refer to the ‘Dorsal’ and ‘Ventral’ pathways:

- The **Dorsal Pathway** (red arrow) is also known as the **‘Where Pathway’**. It is located at the **backside** of the brain.
- The **Ventral Pathway** (yellow arrow) is also known as the **‘What Pathway’**. It is located at the **belly side** of the brain.

## Plasticity in the Brain

The brain is incredibly flexible, a characteristic known as ‘Plasticity’.
This plasticity allows our experiences to shape dedicated clusters of neurons, essentially forming ‘detectors’ within our brain.

A classic example of this is the ‘Sad-Cat Story’, where a cat raised in a room with only vertical stripes had difficulty perceiving horizontal lines.
