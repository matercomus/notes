# Response Times in Cognitive Tasks
![[RT_dist_img.png|400]]

## Processing Response Times
When analyzing response times (RTs) in cognitive tasks, we typically:

- Exclude incorrectly answered trials.
- Exclude very atypical trials (i.e., trials with RT beyond several standard deviations from the mean).

## Distributions of Response Times

Looking at the distribution of RTs can reveal more information. A difference between two response conditions may be more strongly expressed in the faster portion of RTs than in the slower portion.

Certainty that an effect exists depends not just on the means, but on the spread.
-> The extent to which the distributions overlap.

## Case Study: The Stroop Task

The Stroop task is a classic cognitive task where word meaning impacts processing of the word’s print color and vice versa. Participants see words like “RED” and “BLUE”, printed in red or blue. They respond to either the meaning of the word or the print color of the word. Responses are typically slower when the meaning and color don’t match (incongruent) compared to when they do match (congruent).

## Analyzing Response Times

When calculating the mean RTs in each condition, we indeed see effects of meaning/print congruency. However, looking at density plots can provide more insight:

- If **early RTs are very similar** between conditions, **but late RTs differ a lot**, this suggests that the effect has a **late temporal locus** (left image).
- Conversely, if **late RTs are very similar** between conditions, but **early RTs differ a lot**, this suggests that the effect has an **early temporal locus** (right image).
