# Attention

## Definition

Attention is the mind’s capacity to enhance and suppress sensory input and internal representations. It also applies to things that we keep in memory.

## Need for Attention
![[attention_too_many_thoughts_img.png|300]]
Our brain cannot do an infinite number of computations at once, both consciously and subconsciously. 
Computations must be run to completion at the expense of other computations, both consciously and subconsciously.

## Types of Attention

### Overt & Covert Attention
- **Overt Attention**: Obvious to others; the eyes and head move.
- **Covert Attention**: Concealed to others; the eyes and head do not move.

### Spatial vs. Feature-based Attention
- **Spatial Attention**: Attentional orienting in vision is often spatial.
- **Feature-based Attention**: You can choose to be more ‘sensitive’ to certain features; we focus in terms of both where and what.

### Endogenous vs. Exogenous Attention
- **Endogenous Attention**: Internally driven (by ourselves).
