# Accuracy in Cognitive Tasks

## Interchangeability with Response Times

Analyses of accuracy are often regarded as being interchangeable with analyses of response times (RTs). Better performance is typically associated with shorter RTs and fewer errors. In most behavioral tasks, we look at both measures to provide a broader picture. However, in some lines of research, such as memory research, we might only look at one measure.

## Discrepancies Between Accuracy and RTs

- If we find an effect in accuracy but not in RTs, it’s not problematic. 
	  For example, if persons A and B are equally fast, but A is more accurate, A performed better. Similarly, if A and B are equally accurate, but A did it quicker, A performed better.
- If opposite effects are found in accuracy and RTs, it’s problematic. 
	  For example, if person A is better at shooting, but person B is better at skiing, we cannot tell who is the better biathlete.

## Combining RTs and Accuracy: Inverse Efficiency Scores

Inverse Efficiency Scores (IES) combine RTs and accuracy into one measure, which may allow us to make better direct comparisons. 
The formula for IES is $RT / P(correct)$. 
For example:

- If RT = 500 ms and accuracy = 0.90, then IES = 500/0.90 = 556 ms.
- If RT = 480 ms and accuracy = 0.80, then IES = 480/0.80 = 600 ms.
