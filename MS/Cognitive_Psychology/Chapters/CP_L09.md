# Interfaces

All man-made environments are interfaces. Design determines how well its users can achieve their goals and tasks. Environments are interfaces because they provide information that guide user decisions.

## Good Design
Good design considers perception, expectation, attention, and memory. Here are some principles and examples:

### Perception

1. **Reduce signal-to-noise ratio (SDT!):** Enhance contrast, size, illumination, etc. For example, a website with a clean layout and high contrast between text and background improves readability.
2. **Don’t refer to more than 5 things with a single sensory dimension:** For instance, a pie chart should not have more than 5 different colors to represent different data points.
3. **Take top-down processing into account:** Design should consider the user’s prior knowledge and expectations. For example, placing the “save” button where users typically expect it.
4. **Redundancy gain:** Convey information in multiple ways. For example, traffic lights use both colors and positions to convey information.
5. **Make things discriminable:** Different elements should be distinguishable from each other. For example, using different icons for different functions in an app.

### Expectation

6. **Realism:** Display elements should correspond to the real world. For example, a trash bin icon for deleting files.
7. **Realism – moving edition:** Animations should mimic real-world physics. For example, a “swipe” gesture on a mobile device mimics the physical action of moving papers.

### Attention

8. **Minimize access cost:** Navigating from one important location to another shouldn’t take effort. For example, placing frequently used features on the home screen of an app.
9. **Proximity compatibility:** Related items should be grouped together. For example, related options in a menu should be grouped together.
10. **Divide processing load among the senses:** Use visual, auditory, and tactile feedback as appropriate. For example, a notification can have a visual pop-up, an auditory alert, and a vibration.

### Memory

11. **Balance memory and perception:** We do not have to memorize what we can see, and vice versa. For example, a good user interface does not require users to remember information from one part of the interface to another.
12. **Aid predictions (same as principle 11):** The system should show patterns that users can predict what will happen next.
13. **Safeguard consistency:** Keep design elements consistent throughout the interface. For example, if a particular color indicates an interactive element in one part of an app, it should do so throughout the app.

These principles help ensure that an interface is user-friendly and effective in helping users achieve their goals.
