# LLMs and analyses reporting

**1. Linear Mixed-Effect Models (LMMs)**:

LMMs are statistical models that are particularly useful for data analysis where observations are made on the same subjects over time or space, leading to potential correlations between observations. These models can account for:

- **Fixed Effects**: These are the variables of interest in your study. They are “fixed” because they represent specific levels of a variable that you have chosen to study. For example, age is often treated as a fixed effect in LMMs because it is an ordinal variable that can have a significant impact on the outcome.
    
- **Random Effects**: These are variables that may introduce variability into the data but are not the primary focus of the study. They are “random” because their levels are not specifically chosen by you but rather are sampled from a larger population.
    

LMMs are suitable for analyzing data with complex structures, such as repeated measures or hierarchical grouping.

**Binomial Model in LMMs**:

A binomial model is used when the response variable is a count of the number of successes from a fixed number of independent trials. This is often referred to as binomial distribution. The usual outcomes are 1 or 0, alive or dead, success or failure. For example, you might use a binomial model if you’re studying the number of seeds that germinated from the total number of seeds planted, or the number of plants that survived drought from the total number of plants. In these cases, each trial (e.g., each seed or each plant) has two possible outcomes (success or failure), and you’re interested in the count of successes.

**2. Fixed Effects**: These are the variables of interest in your study. They are “fixed” because they represent specific levels of a variable that you have chosen to study. For example, the fixed effect in your tutorial is the picture-sound congruency (congruent vs. incongruent).

**2.1 Age as a Fixed Effect**: Age is often treated as a fixed effect in LMMs because it is an ordinal variable that can have a significant impact on the outcome. Age can influence behavior, attitudes, health, and many other aspects of life. Therefore, even if age is not part of the hypothesis, it’s often included as a fixed effect in the model to account for its potential influence.

**3. Random Effects**: These are variables that may introduce variability into the data but are not the primary focus of the study. They are “random” because their levels are not specifically chosen by you but rather are sampled from a larger population. In your tutorial, the random effects include subjects, animal type, animal picture, and sound.

**4. Intercepts and Slopes**: The intercept is the expected value of the dependent variable when all predictors are zero. A slope, on the other hand, represents the expected change in the dependent variable for each one-unit change in a predictor. In LMMs, both intercepts and slopes can be modeled as fixed or random effects.

**5. Modeling Approach**: The structure of your model should be theory-driven. It’s generally reasonable to assume that effects may vary across subjects, so including random slopes is often a good default.

**6. Model Comparison**: You can compare models with and without random slopes to see which explains more variance. This can be done using a likelihood-ratio test.

**7. Rejecting the Null Hypothesis**: The null hypothesis is rejected when the p-value is less than the significance level. The significance level (alpha) is usually set at 0.05, meaning there’s a 5% risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when it’s true.

**8. Interpreting P-value, T-value, and Z-score in LMMs**: - **P-value**: The p-value in a hypothesis test tells us how likely we would get a test statistic as extreme as the one we observed assuming that the null hypothesis is true. - **T-value**: The t-value measures the size of the difference relative to the variation in your sample data. - **Z-score**: Z-scores are measures of standard deviation.

**9. Reporting Results**: When reporting your analyses, mention the fixed and random effects in your model, provide values of b (estimate), SE (standard error), and t (t-value). A t-value greater than |1.96| is typically considered significant.

Remember that these interpretations are based on certain assumptions that your data meet the requirements of the specific statistical test you’re using. Always make sure to check these assumptions when interpreting your results.
