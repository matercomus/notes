# Theory in Research

## The Role of Theory

- **Theory** is an instrument in research, dictating what we investigate and why.
- It’s not always necessary. Purely descriptive/observational research can be useful too.
- Ultimately, science is about discovering the laws that connect all things, not just knowing everything. These laws are captured in theory.

## Characteristics of a Good Theory

- **Explanatory scope**: A good theory should be able to explain a wide range of phenomena.
- **Parsimony**: The theory should be as simple as possible while still explaining the observed phenomena.
- **Falsifiability**: A theory must be testable. If it cannot be tested, we have zero knowledge about its plausibility.

## Testing a Theory in Cognitive Psychology

- The cognitive psychologist’s challenge: How can we manipulate ‘A’ and measure ‘B’?
- Example: “Expectations influence perception”
    - We need experimental conditions (e.g., one with ‘high expectation’, the other with ‘low expectation’)
    - We need to devise a behavioral measure of perception (e.g., an indication by a participant whether a visual object is blue or yellow)
    - Everything must be quantifiable. We must be able to translate everything into numbers.

## Accounting for Other Factors

- Other factors that potentially have an influence should be taken into account.
- Example: Sensitivity to certain colors may vary with age, or the color of the sky outside may influence responses.
- Experimental designs can help control for these factors:
    - **Within-subjects design**: Each subject is tested in all conditions.
    - **Between-subjects design**: Different subjects are tested in each condition.
    - A within-subjects design is typically preferred as it allows us to ignore factors that potentially have an influence.

# The Replication Crisis in Psychology

## Overview

- The replication crisis in psychology refers to the issue that approximately **40%** of published studies could be replicated. This raises the question: might **60%** of the science out there be erroneous?

## Causes

- **Publication bias**: Also known as the “file drawer problem”, where studies with negative results are less likely to be published.
- **Bad practices**: These can be both intentional and unintentional, often driven by the pressure to produce ‘sexy’ results.

## Solutions

- **Abundant statistical power**: This increases the chance that an effect is established, given that the hypothesis is true. Brysbaert & Stevens (2018) suggest 1,600 measurements per condition (e.g., 25 subjects, 64 trials per condition).
- **Replicate our own experiments**: This helps to confirm the validity of the results.
- **Engage in theory-driven research**: Preferably attempting to falsify a theory rather than to confirm it.

## Testing Theories Without Experiments

- **Computational models**: We can test the extent to which a computer model can accurately simulate behavior. The more accurately it simulates behavior, the more support we have for each of the model’s assumptions.

## Summary

- Theories are instruments, just like methods and techniques. Methods dictate how we investigate things, while theory dictates what we investigate and why.
- Without theories, we can still make valuable observations. But theories are the glue that should hold everything together.
- The 3 characteristics of a good theory: Explanatory scope, Parsimony, and Falsifiability.
- Hypothesis: A → B. Our mission: devise ways to manipulate A, and to measure (quantify) B.
- When possible, stick to a within-subjects design.

- For a future without replication crisis: 
- Have abundant statistical power, replicate our own experiments, aim to falsify theories
- Approx. 1,600 measurements per condition should do.
- Testing theory without experiment: computational model. 
- Model outputs behavior, behavior is compared to human behavior; the more resemblance, the more support for model assumptions.
