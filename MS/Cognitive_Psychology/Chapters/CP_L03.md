# Recap

## Sensation vs. Perception
There’s a thin line between sensation and perception. While sensation involves simple awareness due to sensory stimulation, perception involves understanding sensory information to interact with the world.

## Bottom-up & Top-down Processes
Perception involves both bottom-up and top-down processes. In vision, this means processing starts from the back of the brain (lower levels of cognition) and moves towards the front (higher levels of cognition).

## Neuronal Plasticity
Neuronal plasticity refers to the ability of neurons to change their connections and behavior in response to new information, sensory stimulation, development, damage, or dysfunction.

## Attention
- Attention is the mind’s capacity to enhance and suppress sensory input and internal representations.
- It exists because the brain can only do so many computations at once.

## Types of Attention
- **Spatial vs. Feature-based Attention**: Spatial attention is about where we focus, while feature-based attention is about what we focus on.
- **Endogenous vs. Exogenous Attention**: Endogenous attention is internally driven, while exogenous attention is externally driven.
- **Overt vs. Covert Attention**: Overt attention is obvious to others (the eyes and head move), while covert attention is concealed to others (the eyes and head do not move).

## Neural Dynamics
Remember the neural dynamics explanation: neurons have thresholds for when to fire. The more a neuron is excited, the more frequently it will fire action potentials. Some connections are inhibitory rather than excitatory.

## Hemispatial Neglect
Hemispatial neglect is a condition in which, after damage to one hemisphere of the brain, a deficit in attention to and awareness of one side of the field of vision is observed.
