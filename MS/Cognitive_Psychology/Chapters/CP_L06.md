# Eye-Tracking and Pupillometry

Eye-tracking is a technology that measures where we are looking, also known as our point of gaze. Pupillometry is the measurement of pupil diameter, which can be influenced by factors such as light, cognitive load, and emotional state.

## Descriptive Research

In the context of eye-tracking, descriptive research might involve studying the characteristics of eye movements themselves. This could include understanding patterns of saccades (rapid eye movements), fixations (when the eye is relatively still), and blinks. The goal is to describe these phenomena as they occur naturally.

## Explanatory Research

Explanatory research with eye-tracking aims to use eye movement data to infer cognitive processes. For example, researchers might use changes in pupil diameter as an index of cognitive load or emotional arousal.

## Terminology

Here are some key terms related to eye-tracking:

- **Saccade**: A rapid movement of the eye between fixation points.
- **Saccadic Amplitude**: The angular distance or angle that the eye travels during a saccade.
- **Saccadic Latency**: The time it takes for a saccade to begin after the onset of a stimulus.
- **Fixation**: A period when the eye is relatively still and we gather visual information.
- **Fixation Duration**: The length of time during which the eye is relatively still.
- **Microsaccade**: A very small, involuntary saccade that occurs during attempted visual fixation.

## Eye Position: Two Signals

Eye position can be determined by two signals: pupil location and corneal reflection of (infrared) light sent from a camera. To accurately determine eye position, a calibration process is typically performed where the participant looks at specific points on a screen.

## Decision-Making and Eye-Tracking

Eye-tracking can provide valuable insights into decision-making processes. For example, in a variant of the Posner cueing task, attention is biased by top-down cues. It takes longer for you to note the square on the right when the arrow points to the left. This task relied on both attention and decision-making processes.

## Pupillary Light Response

The pupillary light response refers to how our pupils adjust in response to changes in light levels. Interestingly, this response can also occur in relation to memorized brightness.

In conclusion, eye-tracking and pupillometry provide valuable tools for studying perception, attention, decision-making, and other cognitive processes.
