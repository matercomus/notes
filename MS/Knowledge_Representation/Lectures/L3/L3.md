#  Introduction to Description Logic

## Knowledge Graphs
- Wikidata and DBPedia reflect knowledge of Wikipedia 
- Search Engines: Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. 
- Question answering systems: WolframAlpha, Siri, Alexa 
- Social Networks: Facebook, LinkedIn

Explicit representations

Limitations:
- only explicit knowledge
- incomplete knowledge
- not straightforward to link data

It can be useful for an AI system to “understand” these data
- ... to infer implicit information
- ... to integrate data from different sources
- ... to intelligently answer queries

## Ontologies
“For AI systems, what ‘exists’ is exactly that which can be represented.” (Gruber, 1993)

"An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization.” (Gruber 1994; Staab, Studer, 2009)

Conceptualizations (after Gruber 1994) 
A conceptualization is given by:
- a domain of discourse
- a set of conceptual relations, for example:
	- concepts (unary predicates),
	- roles or relations (binary predicates)
- for different states of the world, and different possible worlds


We usually consider a simplified view based on first-order structures:
- possible worlds correspond to interpretations
- the domain of discourse is not fixed
- as conceptual relations we consider concepts (unary) and roles (binary)

### Formal, Explicit Specifications 
Extensional specification:
- explicitly state the elements of the conceptual relations
Intensional specification:
- constrain concepts and roles in the different possible worlds
- axiomatize
- formal languages make these specifications precise
- dedicated languages make them human readable

### Ontologies in Practice

#### Search and Semantic
Web Schema.org
- Launched in 2011 by Bing, Google and Yahoo!
- Selection of schemas for metadata of web content
- Influences for example search results by Google’s Knowledge Graph
- Relatively small:
	- 797 Concepts, 1,453 Roles

#### SNOMED CT
Medical ontology

#### Gene Ontology (GO)
- Developed by the Gene Ontology consortium since 1998
- Biological processes and their interactions
- 63.000 concepts and 300 roles
- Main application: biological research

#### Common Core Ontologies
- Developed by non-profit R&D company CUBRC, since 2010
- Formalize generic notions found in many applications

many many more...

### Ontology Languages 
There are very different ontology languages used in practice:
- Higher order logic (SUMO)
	- relatively rare- limited practicality
- RDFS
	- “Rich Data Format Schema”
	- very common for knowledge graphs in RDF
	- limited expressivity
	- complicated semantics
	- covered in Masters course “Knowledge Representation in the Web”
- Datalog
	- Rule-based language
	- Common systems are RDFOx, VLog and Nemo
- OWL
	- “Web Ontology Language”
	- Most expressive decidable formalism in this list
	- Based on description logics

 Existing ontologies vary a lot in size and expressivity
	- some ontologies are just taxonomies
	- others allow for complex logical inferencing
- Many knowledge graphs are used without or with very simple ontologies
	- in Wikidata, a lot of relevant knowledge is already there
	- terms are often not used coherently enough to allow for logical reasoning
- In the context of this course, we are interested in the more expressive ontology formalisms


## The Description Logic ALC
Description logics (DLs)
- are **decidable** fragments of first-order logic
- are restricted to **unary** and **binary** predicates
- use a **special** **syntax** for formulas
- have the specification of ontologies as main use case

#### Vocabulary #TODO 
- concepts
- roles
- objects

#### Semantics
Semantics is used to specify the meaning of DL expressions
- As for classical logics, we use interpretations for this
- Recall propositional logic:
	- Vocabulary consists of propositional variables
	- Interpretations assign true or false to those
- For the DL vocabulary, we need to talk about individual objects and their relations

#### Interpretations #TODO 


#### Concepts

### From Concepts to Ontologies
- Interpretations are arbitrary
	- We usually do not know which interpretation is the correct one
- Only some will be models of our conceptualization
- To specify what is a model, we use axioms
- Axioms
	- express constraints on interpretations
	- relate concepts to other concepts
	- relate concepts to individuals
- An ontology is then a collection of axioms.

- DL ontologies are sets of axioms
- Axioms put constraints on interpretations
- We distinguish two types:
	- terminological axioms put concepts in relation
	- assertions relate individual names with concepts and roles
- They respectively form the TBox and the ABox of an ontology
- An interpretation satisfying such an axiom/ontology is a model
- I satisfies α: I |= α
